  ### Smart trash detection and collection in cities
</p>

## Abstract
Tasbin uses deep learning to detect piles of trash in the streets of a city. Specifically, it makes use of convolutional neural networks implemented in Google's Tensorflow machine learning library to detect, in real time, trash on the city grounds. 

## How it works

### Tasbin collects data in two ways: 
1.	**High speed cameras on government vehicles:** We can integrate high speed cameras on government vehicles to capture images of the city streets as it moves. These images are processed by our algorithms to detect piles of trash. 
2.	**Crowd source:** Citizens can capture images or videos of the trash and uploaded to our servers using a simple smartphone application
After analyzing the footage collected, we create a heat map of the city, indicating how the trash is distributed on the city grounds.  

## How it can be used
The heat map generated by our algorithms can be used to more efficiently collect the garbage in the city. For example, it can define the amount of personnel needed to be sent to each area, the route they need to take and the best hours of the day to collect the garbage. 
In addition, it can help in detecting areas were trash piles up, but not collected as frequently as necessary. 

## Who might be interested?
*	Communities that care about their citizens
*	Trash collecting companies that care about reducing their costs
*	Tourism organizations, that care about sending the right image to the tourists about a clean and smart city.
